<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
Hi! I'm Mark and I'm the founder of Yuri.ai a company that aims to help game developers more easily build intelligent agents in their games. In my past lives I've worked as a researcher, developer and program manager at Microsoft, NASA's JPL, UC Berkeley and UCSD.

In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, board games, electronics and robotics.
